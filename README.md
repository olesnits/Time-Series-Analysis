# Time-Series-Analysis

The Campochiaro plant is powered by four internal motors plus some external energy source that is eventually purchased incurring in extra costs. Every day the surplus energy gets wasted leading us to an optimization problem: considering the four motors available at FATERâ€™s plant, their best usage configuration should be found in order to minimize the costs and the waste of energy , in three specific dates (19-11-2019, 16-01-2020 and 18-06-2020).To do so, different datasets were provided, most of them describe the power consumption over the days with a minute-by-minute granularity, while another dataset takes into account the scheduled productions for each type of item and their delivered quantity over the days. Other information regarding the cost of the motors, external energy, minimum and maximum energy produced by each motor are provided as well.
